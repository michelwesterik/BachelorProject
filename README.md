# BachelorProject
This is the repository connected to the bachelor thesis "Permutation Test Compared to Welch t-Test for Non-Normal Distributions"
by Michel Westerik, Leiden University.

The "scripts" branch contains all scripts used for our simulation study, "mainscript" can be executed to source all other scripts 
and run the full simulation. K can be adjusted in "SimulationAllCells", with k=10000 as default. Further comments are included within the scripts.

The "Results" branch contains a folder with all results of our simulation study in R, as well as a sav file for SPSS.
