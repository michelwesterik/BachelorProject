# BachelorProject
The "scripts" branch contains all scripts used for our simulation study, "mainscript" can be executed to source all other scripts and run the full simulation. K can be adjusted in "SimulationAllCells", with k=10000 as default. Further comments are included within the scripts. The only package which needs to be installed for running the simulation is "perm". This can be done by entering: install.packages("perm").
For the second simulation with the Welch statistic permutation test, there are changes to the "Preparation" and "Method_new" scripts. These edited scripts are provided in the "WelchStatisticScripts" folder, these scripts can replace the original ones.
